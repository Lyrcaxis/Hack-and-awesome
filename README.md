# Hack-and-awesome

- ###### Short demo of a 3D Isometric Hack 'n' Slash game with simplistic graphics & sounds, and various post-processing effects to amplify visuals.
- ###### Project works as is on Unity 2020.1.3f1. If used with other versions, you'll need to re-touch lightning and TMPro settings.

###### Level design by [@Virimine](https://www.github.com/Virimine).
